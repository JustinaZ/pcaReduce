Description: pcaReduce delivers hierarchical representation of single cell RNA-seq data via dimensionality reduction and clustering. It is based on integration of two tools: K-means clustering algorithm and principal components analysis. pcaReduce uses agglomerative clustering to generate a cell state hierarchy, where each cluster branch is associated with a principal component of variation that can assist in differentiating two cellular states. Therefore, it can be applied for characterising cell state identity.
